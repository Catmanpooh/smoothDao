This repo aims to be a home for any programmable data project that builds off of the DealClient contract.  We'll accept any PRs for contract variants that offer something new and don't break the build.  Your contract is more likely to pass PR review if it is well documented so it is obvious that it provides something new.  For now just add your contract to the [src directory](https://github.com/lotus-web3/client-contract/tree/main/src) and open a PR.  If this starts to get too much for build times or other reasons we'll look into creating sub projects.

Note we're explicitly not reviewing contracts added here for correctness.  All sorts of accidental or malicious bugs could be introduced in contracts added here so please do your own research / auditing and use at your own risk.
